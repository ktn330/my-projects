		<h3 class="p1">Hello people! My name is Kwadwo T.Nyamekye (Kojo) for short. I have done alot of jobs in my life time. The most suprising thing for me though is that the set of work skills that have made me the most money is driving! Every job have ever had that paid me the most money is driving. The other incentive is also i get board being indoors all day. Driving has been a graet expericance for me. It taken me meny places and its shown me and introduced me to many things. I know that i spacifically got lucky casue of my social network but you know can't credit all my life to luck.

			<h3 class="p1">
		 But now it is time for a change. Im going full nomad workforce. My hope is to learn as much code as possible to forward me to nomadic worker status. Work from home or bust!
		Before i go though i must amke a small note of the horrors and triumphs of my life as a perofessional driver.</h3>
